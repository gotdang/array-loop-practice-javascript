# array-loop-practice-javascript
Student exercises that reinforce understanding of how arrays and loops work together in JavaScript. All work is done in the `.js` file, and results appear in the console.

## Audience
The audience for these exercises is people who are relatively new to programming in JavaScript, who have learned about arrays and loops, and who would like to practice using them together. Most of the loops in the early exercises use the "traditional" C-like loop syntax:

`for (initialization; condition; iteration) { ...steps to repeat... }`

I have found students who need practice deciding when to use the index vs the array item. Several solutions require understanding the difference.

## Usage
Clone or fork the repository. Edit the `.js` file on your computer. View the results in your browser's Console.

## Future

Over time, I expect to better organize them according to complexity. I also intend future challenges to perform the same tasks using different techniques, such as the array functional methods.
